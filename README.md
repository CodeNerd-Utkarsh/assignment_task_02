## Assignment 1 :- Create a web application using create-react-app:

1. Create a User card grid layout having navbar showing any brand name
2. Add a button in the navbar saying 'Get Users', which makes an API call to get the user data
3. Use https://reqres.in/api/users?page=1 to get the data
4. Show a loader while the API fetches the data.
5. Use custom **CSS/SASS/styled-components** whichever you feel comfortable, **but no CSS framework**.
6. Bonus points for clean code. 
7. You can design your own UI for this, make it simple.
